# Legend for defining a "referred" dot set
# R :: <NewCam> :: <NewName> :: <NewRes> :: <ExistCam> :: <ExistSet> :: <Offset>
#
# NewCam = Camera model for the new dot set, "650D" for instance
# NewName = some arbitrary, unique name for the new dot set
# NewRes = RAW resolution the new dot set applies to (as CSV)
# ExistCam = Name of the camera model for the referred dot set
# ExistSet = Name of the referred dot set for that cam
# Offset = coordinate offset from existing to new dot set as CSV
#

#
# Dummy example

R :: 650M :: RefTest :: 800,600 :: 650D :: Silent_1808x727 :: 70,70

# Silent DNGs in movie mode

R :: 650D :: SilentMovie :: 1808,1190 :: 650D :: Video_1270x720 :: 304, 246
